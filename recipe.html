        <h1>Burgers Recipe</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>The name <i>"hamburger"</i> comes from the seaport town of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Hamburg-Germany" target="_blank">Hamburg, Germany</a>, where it is thought that 19th-century sailors brought back the idea of raw shredded beef after trading with the Baltic provinces of Russia. Some anonymous German chef decided to cook the beef.</p>
        <p>The hamburger made its first United States appearance at the <b>St. Louis Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904.</b>The hamburger is one of America's favorite foods. It consists of a cooked patty of ground beef sandwiched between two bread halves, usually in the form of a round bun</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb 85/15 ground beef <i>(chuck and brisket)</i></li>
            <li>2 oz frozen unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp granulated garlic or garlic powder</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 slices swiss cheese</li>
            <li>toppings and condiments of your choice <i>(Optional)</i></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat on half and low on the other half.</li>
            <li>In a medium size mixing bowl, place the ground beef. Using a box grater, grate <br> the frozen butter and add to the beef and distribute the butter evenly.</li>
            <li>Form the beef mixture into two patties, about 4 inches wide and one inch thick <br>so when the beef is fully cooked it will shrink to the size of the bun. Lay the <br>patties on a sheet tray or plate and chill for at least ten minutes. Season all sides of the patties generously.</li>
            <li>Oil the meat well on both sides and place onto the medium heat side of the grill. <br>Cook to get nice grill marks for about two minutes, then rotate the patties 90 degrees to cross hatch and <br>cook again for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly butter the brioche buns and add to the low heated grill side. Cover the meat <br>with Swiss Cheese and close the lid on the grill for 1-2 minutes, checking the buns so that they do not burn.</li>
            <li>Apply your toppings and enjoy your burger</li>
        </ol>
